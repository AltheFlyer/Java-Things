# Java Practice

Algorithms contains examples of algorithm logic (e.g Quicksort).  
Graph Theory contains simple graph generation and traversal examples.  
Java Things contains experiments with different Java constructs (e.g FileReader, ImageReader).  
Window Stuff contains attempts at using Java swing and AWT components.  
src contains anything that I make purely for fun, or for things that don't belong anywhere else.
